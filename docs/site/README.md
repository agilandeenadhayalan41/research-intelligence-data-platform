# Documentation site

This folder is a [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/) site that publishes the
repository's `docs/` folder. It reads the Markdown **in place**: the pages are
the files under `docs/overview/` and `docs/architecture/`, so the same files
render on GitHub and on the site. Nothing is copied or moved.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docusaurus.config.ts` | Site config: docs plugin pointed at `..` (the `docs/` folder), strict link checks, Mermaid |
| `sidebars.ts` | Sidebar: Overview, then the architecture docs grouped by area, with short labels |
| `src/remark/repo-links.mjs` | Rewrites relative links that leave `docs/` (for example `../../sql/...`) to GitHub URLs |
| `src/css/custom.css` | Theme colours and table/diagram overflow rules |
| `static/img/logo.svg` | Navbar logo and favicon |

## Requirements

Node.js 20 or newer (tested with Node.js 24 and npm 11). Run every command from
this folder (`docs/site`).

## Local commands

```bash
npm ci            # install the exact versions from package-lock.json
npm start         # dev server with live reload on http://localhost:3000
npm run build     # production build into build/ (fails on any broken link)
npm run serve     # serve the production build on http://localhost:3000
npm run typecheck # type-check the TypeScript config files
```

`npm run serve -- --port 3077` serves on another port.

## Writing docs

- Add or edit Markdown under `docs/` (not under `docs/site/`). `.md` files are
  parsed as CommonMark, the same way GitHub renders them, so `<` and `{` need
  no escaping. Use `.mdx` only when a page needs React components.
- A new page must be added to `sidebars.ts`, using its path under `docs/`
  without the extension (for example `architecture/roadmap`). Give it a short
  `label` there if its H1 is long.
- Link to other docs with relative `.md` paths (`../architecture/roadmap.md`,
  `postgres-warehouse.md#known-limitations`). Link to code with relative paths
  too (`../../sql/control/001_pipeline_control.sql`); the site turns those into
  GitHub links on the `main` branch. A code link must point at a file that is
  committed to git. The build only checks that the path exists on disk, so a
  link to an ignored or uncommitted local file passes a local build, fails the
  Vercel build (whose checkout has tracked files only) and would 404 on GitHub.
- ```` ```mermaid ```` code blocks render as diagrams.
- The build fails on a broken page link, a broken `#anchor` or a link to a repo
  file that does not exist, so `npm run build` is the check to run before a
  pull request.
- Never put cloud project IDs, bucket names, account emails or other private
  identifiers in a doc: the repository and the site are public.

## Deploying on Vercel

The repository root has a `vercel.json` that builds this folder as a static
site, so the project can be imported with the default settings:

1. In Vercel, choose **Add New... > Project** and import the GitHub repository.
2. Leave **Root Directory** as the repository root. `vercel.json` sets the
   framework to none (Other), the install command
   (`npm ci --prefix docs/site`), the build command
   (`npm run build --prefix docs/site`) and the output directory
   (`docs/site/build`).
3. Deploy. Every push to `main` then updates production, and each pull request
   gets a preview URL.

The site's canonical URL comes from `SITE_URL` when set, otherwise from the
`VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` that Vercel provides on every build, otherwise
`http://localhost:3000`. Vercel exposes that variable only while the project's
**Automatically expose System Environment Variables** setting is on (the
default). After importing, check that it is on, or set `SITE_URL`; otherwise
the sitemap and canonical links point at `localhost`. Set `SITE_URL` in the
Vercel project's environment variables when a custom domain is added.

The site has no search box yet. Adding one needs a search plugin dependency
(for example a local-search plugin at a pinned version), which is a separate
change.
